# Nodejs-Practice-code

A collection of small Node.js projects and practice exercises maintained by MuqhtadeerM. This repository is intended as a personal playground to try out Node.js features, patterns, and libraries — from tiny scripts to small services and experiments.

## About
This repo stores practice code for learning and experimenting with Node.js. Each exercise or small project should be isolated so it can be run and tested independently.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS; e.g. v18 or v20)
- npm or pnpm or yarn (whichever you prefer)
- Git

## Repository structure (suggested)
This repo may contain multiple small projects. A suggested layout:

- /projects/ or /examples/ — main folder containing individual projects
  - /projects/http-server/
    - package.json
    - index.js
    - README.md (for project-specific notes)
  - /projects/crud-api/
  - /projects/cli-tools/
- /scripts/ — small utility scripts used across projects
- /.github/ — CI workflows (optional)
- README.md — this file

Note: If your repo currently has a different layout, update the README to match.

## How to run a project
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MuqhtadeerM/Nodejs-Practice-code.git
   cd Nodejs-Practice-code
   ```

2. Find the project you want to run (for example `projects/http-server`) and follow that project's README. Common steps:
   ```
   cd projects/http-server
   npm install
   npm start      # or `node index.js`
   ```

Example minimal HTTP server (you can place this in `projects/http-server/index.js`):
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello from Nodejs-Practice-code!\n');
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});
```

## Common workflows
- Create a new folder for each experiment or small project.
- Add a `package.json` if using npm packages:
  ```
  npm init -y
  npm install <packages>
  ```
- Add a short `README.md` inside each project to explain purpose and how to run it.
- Keep code small and focused — one idea per project.

## Adding a new practice project
1. Add a folder under `projects/` with a descriptive kebab-case name (e.g. `projects/file-watcher`).
2. Add a `README.md` that describes the project and how to run it.
3. Add a `package.json` if needed.
4. Commit and push:
   ```
   git checkout -b feat/add-file-watcher
   git add projects/file-watcher
   git commit -m "Add file-watcher practice project"
   git push origin feat/add-file-watcher
   ```
5. Open a PR when you want to merge changes into main.

## Contribution guidelines
This repository is primarily for your personal practice. If you accept contributions:
- Use clear commit messages.
- Open an issue or PR describing the change.
- Keep the scope of PRs small and focused.
- Include tests or usage examples where helpful.

## Testing
For small exercises you can use:
- Node built-in assertions and simple test scripts
- Jest, Mocha, or other test runners for more structured tests

Example:
```
cd projects/some-project
npm install --save-dev jest
npx jest
```

## Formatting and linting
Consider using:
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for consistent formatting
Add configuration files at the repo root or per-project as needed.

If you'd like, I can:
- Commit this README.md to the repository for you, creating a branch and opening a PR, or
- Tailor the README to exactly match the current project list in your repo (I can read the repo and produce a project-specific README).
Which would you prefer? 
```
